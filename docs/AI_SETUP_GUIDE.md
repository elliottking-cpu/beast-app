# 🤖 AI Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

Your Business Intelligence Platform is now ready for AI integration! I've built a comprehensive system using **Anthropic Claude** + **Supabase Edge Functions** for the most reliable, cost-effective, and powerful AI experience.

## 🎯 Why This Architecture?

**✅ Recommended: Anthropic Claude + Supabase Edge Functions**

### Benefits:
- **🔒 Secure**: API keys stored safely in Supabase, never exposed to frontend
- **💰 Cost-Effective**: Claude is cheaper than GPT-4 with better business reasoning
- **🚀 Scalable**: Supabase Edge Functions auto-scale with your usage
- **🛡️ Safe**: Built-in safety mechanisms and SQL validation
- **📊 Business-Focused**: Claude excels at complex business analysis
- **🔄 Reliable**: Automatic fallbacks when AI is unavailable

## 📋 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Get Anthropic Claude API Key

1. **Visit**: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. **Sign up** for an Anthropic account
3. **Navigate to**: API Keys section
4. **Create** a new API key
5. **Copy** the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

**💡 Pricing**: Claude is very affordable for business use:
- **Input**: $3 per 1M tokens (~750,000 words)
- **Output**: $15 per 1M tokens (~750,000 words)
- **Typical cost**: $5-20/month for heavy business use

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Environment Variables

1. **Open** your Supabase Dashboard
2. **Navigate to**: Settings → Environment Variables
3. **Add** the following variable:

```bash
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Edge Function

1. **Install** Supabase CLI (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

2. **Login** to Supabase:
```bash
supabase login
```

3. **Link** your project:
```bash
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
```

4. **Deploy** the AI Edge Function:
```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-chat
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. **Restart** your application
2. **Navigate** to the Business Intelligence Platform
3. **Try** these test queries:
   - "Add a new customer to Yorkshire Septics"
   - "Show me all jobs in YO postcode areas"
   - "Analyze this month's revenue performance"
   - "Optimize tomorrow's job schedule"

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration (Optional)

### Custom Business Context

Edit `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts` to customize the business context:

```typescript
// Add your specific business rules
const businessRules = `
- Standard tank emptying: £150-200
- Emergency callouts: £250+ with 2-hour response
- Maintenance contracts: £50/month per customer
- Coverage area: Yorkshire region (YO, HG, LS postcodes)
`;
```

### Rate Limiting

Adjust rate limits in the Edge Function:

```typescript
const rateLimits = {
  requestsPerMinute: 30,
  requestsPerHour: 500,
  maxTokensPerRequest: 4000
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Claude API key not configured"
**Solution**: Ensure the environment variable is set correctly in Supabase

### Issue: Edge Function not found
**Solution**: Deploy the function using `supabase functions deploy ai-chat`

### Issue: AI responses are slow
**Solution**: This is normal for the first request. Subsequent requests are much faster.

### Issue: Fallback responses only
**Solution**: Check Supabase logs for detailed error messages

## 📊 Monitoring & Usage

### View AI Usage
```sql
-- Check AI conversation logs
SELECT * FROM ai_conversations 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Monitor API costs
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as requests,
  AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM ai_conversations 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Cost Management
- **Set alerts** in Anthropic console for usage limits
- **Monitor** daily usage in Supabase logs
- **Typical usage**: 10-50 requests/day = $1-5/month
